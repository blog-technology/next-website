<h1>Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)</h1>
<p>CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation) is a software architectural pattern that separates the read (query) and write (command) operations of an application into distinct models, rather than using a single model for both.</p>
<h3>‚öôÔ∏è Basic Idea</h3>
<p>Traditionally, in CRUD applications, the same model handles both data reading and writing. In CQRS, you split the responsibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Command Model</b>: Handles write operations (create, update, delete). It focuses on executing business logic and enforcing rules.</li>
<li><b>Query Model</b>: Handles read operations. It&#39;s optimized for fast and flexible querying, often using read-optimized views or projections.</li>
</ul>
<h3>üì¶ Example</h3>
<p>Imagine an e-commerce system:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a user places an order, it&#39;s a command (PlaceOrderCommand).</li>
<li>When a user views order history, it&#39;s a query (GetOrderHistoryQuery).</li>
</ul>
<p>Under CQRS:</p>
<ul>
<li>The command model validates the business rules and stores the order.</li>
<li>The query model might query a read-optimized table or denormalized view for faster retrieval.</li>
</ul>
<h3>‚ú® Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Scalability</b>: Read and write workloads can be scaled independently. </li>
<li><b>Flexibility</b>: Query model can be tailored for read performance without affecting write logic. </li>
<li><b>Separation of Concerns</b>: Clear distinction between how data is changed and how it is retrieved. </li>
<li><b>Optimized Performance</b>: Read models can be denormalized and indexed for specific queries.</li>
</ul>
<h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-offs</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Increased complexity</b>: More moving parts (especially when used with Event Sourcing).</li>
<li><b>Eventual consistency</b>: If using separate databases for read/write, synchronization can be eventual rather than immediate.</li>
<li><b>Harder to debug</b>: More components to trace when debugging behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h3>üîß When to Use CQRS</h3>
<p>‚úÖ Consider CQRS if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your app has complex business logic and performance issues with queries. </li>
<li>You need to scale reads and writes independently. </li>
<li>You&#39;re implementing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in a large system.</li>
</ul>
<p>üö´ Avoid CQRS if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The domain is simple and CRUD fits well. </li>
<li>The overhead outweighs the benefits.</li>
</ul>
